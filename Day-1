DBMS:
interface between user and user data

darabase components:
hardware,software,end user,data,data query language.

Architecture:
1 tier,2-tier,3-tier

1- tier:- interaction between client and user
2- tier:- client can access the dwatabase through application
3- tier:- client can use only the application layer &system admin can able to use only the presentation layer.

Types of database:
1.Distributed database
2.Centralized database
3.Relational database
4.Graph database
5.NoSQL Database
6.Cloud Database

Relational database[RDBMS]:
	* the known datas stored in the database. 
	* structured way of data. 
	* data will be stored in a table format

NOSQl:
	* to store the non structured way of data.

Distributed database:
	In a database, a single table will  be used by the other databases.

Centalized database:
	In a database, the n number of tables will  be used by the other databases.

Hirarchy database:
	* 1-many & many-1 relationship
	* tree structure
	* top down approch, bottom up approch.

Network database:
	* Many-many relationship
	* Doesnt need a tree structure
	* graph structure.

Cloud database:
	no need any physical storage.


Meta data:
	Information about the information.


Model of data:
Structures:
	* structured data,
	* non structured data,
	* semi structured data.

Er data model:- 
	* through pictorial we can define
	* Structured
	* 1-many,1-1 relationship

	ER model:-
		1.Entity- weak entity:-  an entity that cannot be uniquely identified by its attributes alone; 
		2.Attribute:-
			* Key attribute:- uniquely identify a tuple (or row) in a relation (or table).
			* composite attribute:- those attributes that can further divide into more simple attributes
			* Multivalued attribute:- an attribute that can have multiple value for a single intance of an entity.
			* Derived attribute:-  an attribute in a table that has been derived using other attributes in the database. 
		3.Relation:-
			* 1-1
			* 1-m
			* m-1
			* m-m

object model:-
	Express the ER model

Semi structured:-
	structured or non structured.it have NOSQL
	it use MangoDB



SQL:
1.data defenition language (create,alter,drop,truncate)
2.data manipulation language (insert,update,delete)
3.data control language (command is grand and revoke)
4.transaction control language (commit,rollback,savepoint)
5.Data Query language(Select)
